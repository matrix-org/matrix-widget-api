# Cutting releases

The release process is semi-automatic. To cut a new release, visit [the Actions tab](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/actions/workflows/release.yaml), and select 'Run workflow' with the appropriate version bump.

Once a release is created, go to [the Releases page](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/releases) and edit it with a more useful set of release notes. The 'Generate release notes' button will usually work fine for this purpose.
